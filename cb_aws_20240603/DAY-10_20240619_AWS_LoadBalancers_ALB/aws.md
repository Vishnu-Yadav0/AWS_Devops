```
1. Amazon API Gateway:
    - Region Based Service
    - Create, Maintain and Secure APIs at anyt scale
    - API is a fully managed service
    - It easy for developers to create, public, maintain, monitor and secure API's at any scale.
    - API's act as the "front door" for your applications to access data, business logic or functionality from your backend services.
    - RESTful
    - WebSocket
    - 1 million API calls received free & 12 months

API types: 

RESTful APIs
Build RESTful APIs optimized for serverless workloads and HTTP backends using HTTP APIs. HTTP APIs are the best choice for building APIs that only require API proxy functionality. If your APIs require API proxy functionality and API management features in a single solution, API Gateway also offers REST APIs.

WEBSOCKET APIs
Build real-time two-way communication applications, such as chat apps and streaming dashboards, with WebSocket APIs. API Gateway maintains a persistent connection to handle message transfer between your backend service and your clients.

2. AWS Client VPN : https://aws.amazon.com/vpn/client-vpn/
    
    - Securely connect your remote workforce to AWS or on-premises resources
    - AWS Client VPN is a fully-managed remote access VPN solution used by your remote workforce to securely access resources within both AWS and your on-premises network. Fully elastic, it automatically scales up, or down, based on demand. When migrating applications to AWS, your users access them the same way before, during, and after the move. AWS Client VPN, including the software client, supports the OpenVPN protocol.

3. Amazon CloudFront :
    - Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network operated by Amazon Web Services. The content delivery network was created to provide a globally-distributed network of proxy servers to cache content, such as web videos or other bulky media, more locally to consumers, to improve access speed for downloading the content.
