# Assignment Operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, **=, //=

# 1. Assignment (=)
# Assigns a value to a variable.

a = 10 
print("Assignment: a = ", a)
print(f"Assignment: a = {a}")

# 2. Add and Assign (+=)
# Adds a value to a variable and assigns the result to that variable.

a = 10
a += 5
print(f"Add and Assign: a += 5 results in a = {a}")

# 3. Subtract and Assign (-=)
# Subtracts a value from a variable and assigns the result to that variable.

a = 10
a -= 5
print(f"Subtract and Assign: a -= 5 results in a = {a}")

# 4. Multiply and Assign (*=)
# Multiplies a variable by a value and assigns the result to that variable.
a = 10
a *= 5

print(f"Multiply and Assign: a *= 5 results in a = {a}")

# 5. Divide and Assign (/=)
# Divides a variable by a value and assigns the result to that variable.

a = 10
a /= 5
print(f"Divide and Assign: a /= 5 results in a = {a}")

# 6. Modulus and Assign (%=)
# Performs modulus operation on a variable with a value and assigns the result to that variable.

a = 10
a %= 3
print(f"Modulus and Assign: a %= 3 results in a = {a}")

# 7. Exponent and Assign (**=)
# Raises a variable to the power of a value and assigns the result to that variable.

a = 2
a **= 3
print(f"Exponent and Assign: a **= 3 results in a = {a}")

# 8. Floor Divide and Assign (//=)
# Performs floor division on a variable by a value and assigns the result to that variable.

a = 10
a //= 3
