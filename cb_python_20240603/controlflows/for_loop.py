# A for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string).

'''
for item in sequence:
    # code to execute for each item

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

# You can also use range() to generate a sequence of numbers:
    
for i in range(11):
    print(i)
