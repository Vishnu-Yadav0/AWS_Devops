# Python Operators

'''
Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values. Python supports various operators, including:

1. Arithmetic Operators: +, -, *, /, //, %, **
2. Comparison Operators: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
3. Logical Operators: and, or, not
4. Bitwise Operators: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>
5. Assignment Operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, **=, //=
6. Membership Operators: in, not in
7. Identity Operators: is, is not

# Arithmetic Operators - 1. Arithmetic Operators: +, -, *, /, //, %, **
x = 10
y = 3
# print(x + y)  # 13
# print(x - y)  # 7
# print(x * y)  # 30
# print(x / y)  # 3.3333...
# print(x // y)  # 3
# print(x % y)  # 1
# print(x ** y)  # 1000

# Comparison Operators
# print(x == y)  # False
# print(x != y)  # True
# print(x > y)  # True
# print(x < y)  # False
# print(x >= y)  # True
# print(x <= y)  # False

# Logical Operators
print(x > 5 and y < 5)  # True
print(x > 5 or y > 5)  # True
print(not (x > 5))  # False
