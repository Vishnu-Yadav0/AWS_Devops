# Python Modules

# A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements.

# Modules are used to break down large programs into smaller, manageable, and organized files.

# Create a file named `cloudbinarymodule.py`

'''
# mymodule.py
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

'''

# Then, import and use it in another file:

import cloudbinarymodule

print(cloudbinarymodule.greet("Joel"))
