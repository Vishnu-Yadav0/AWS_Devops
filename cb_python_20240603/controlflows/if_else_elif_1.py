# Python Control Flow Statements

'''
Control flow statements in Python are used to control the order in which the code is executed based on certain conditions. 
'''

# 1. Python if...else
# The if...else statement is used for conditional execution

# if condition:
#     # code to execute if condition is True
# else:
#     # code to execute if condition is False

# Create Variables
# x = 4

# if x > 5:
#     print("x is greater than 5")
# else:
#     print("x is not greater than 5")

# elif for multiple conditions

x = 10
if x > 15:
    print("x is greater than 15")
elif x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5 but not greater than 15")
else:
    print("x is 5 or less")
